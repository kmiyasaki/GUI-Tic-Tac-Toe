# GUI Tic-Tac-Toe

This program allows 1-2 users to play a game of Tic-Tac-Toe using a Graphical User Interface, created with Python. This game can be ran on a single computer or on 2 computers, where the users connect using the Sockets Library. Upon running both **player1.py** and **player2.py** files, ensure that Player 1 matches the host and port information of player 2 for a connection to be made.

The game board and interface was created using the TkInter Library, and each player takes turns making moves on the board by clicking the space they would like to move. Player 1 always makes the first move, and after a game is finished, only player 1 is prompted to play again. If Player 1 chooses not to play again, the statistics are printed onto the screen for both players. 

This program was made using Python 3.10 and can be ran successfully using IDLE, Pycharm, or VSCode. The GUI is optimized for Windows, and may not run or display properly on MacOS devices.
